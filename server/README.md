### Documentation for Backend Service Using Python and FastAPI

#### Overview

This backend service is designed for comprehensive user management using FastAPI. It interfaces with a PostgreSQL database to perform various user-related operations efficiently. The service allows for the creation, retrieval, update, and deletion of user profiles, integrating essential security features for data handling.

#### Technologies Used

- **Python**: A high-level, interpreted language known for its readability and support for multiple programming paradigms.
- **FastAPI**: A modern, fast (high-performance) web framework for building APIs with Python 3.7+ based on standard Python type hints.
- **PostgreSQL**: A powerful, open-source object-relational database system with a strong reputation for reliability, feature robustness, and performance.

#### File Descriptions

- **user_routes.py**: Defines the API routes for user operations such as creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting users.
- **test_user_routes.py**: Contains tests for the user routes to ensure they work as expected under various conditions.
- **config.py**: Holds configuration settings that control aspects like database connection parameters.
- **hashing.py**: Utility functions for password hashing to enhance security.
- **logging.py**: Setup for logging throughout the application, useful for debugging and tracking application flow.
- **user.py**: Defines the ORM model for 'User', detailing the structure of user records in the database. It includes fields such as username, email, and password, alongside methods for interaction with the database like querying and updating records.
- **session.py**: Handles the SQLAlchemy session management for transactions, ensuring that database operations are handled within a session scope to maintain data integrity and support transactional consistency.
- **base.py**: Establishes the base class for all ORM models using SQLAlchemy. This file is foundational for enabling ORM capabilities across the application, allowing for the efficient mapping of Python classes to database tables.

#### API Endpoints

Detailed endpoints include:

- **POST /user/**: Create a new user. This endpoint accepts user data such as username, email, and password, hashes the password, and stores the user information in the database.
- **GET /user/{user_id}**: Retrieve a specific user's details using their ID. This is useful for user profile views and data verification.
- **PUT /user/{user_id}**: Update existing user information. It supports partial updates and ensures data validation before committing to the database.
- **DELETE /user/{user_id}**: Remove a user from the database. This operation is secured to prevent unauthorized deletions and logs the action for auditing purposes.

#### Models

- **User**: Represents a user entity with attributes for identification and authentication. Each user has a unique identifier, username, email address, and a password hash for security.

#### Security Measures

- **JSON Web Tokens (JWT)**: Utilizes JWT for secure authentication across API requests. Tokens are generated upon login and required for accessing secure routes.
- **HTTPS**: All communications with the backend are secured using HTTPS, encrypting data in transit.
- **Password Hashing**: Passwords are hashed using bcrypt, ensuring that plain text passwords are never stored in the database.
- **CORS Policy**: Implements a CORS policy to restrict API access to trusted domains only.
- **Security Audits**: Regular security audits are performed to ensure the application adheres to security best practices.

#### Testing

Detailed testing strategies to ensure robustness include using mock data for simulation of real-world scenarios, boundary testing for data fields, and stress testing for endpoint durability.

#### Configuration

Includes environment-specific variables like database URLs, secret keys, and service endpoints, allowing easy adjustments for development, testing, and production environments.
