### Documentation for Frontend Service Using Next.js

#### Overview

This Next.js application provides a robust frontend interface for user management, interfacing with the backend through RESTful APIs. It offers dynamic, responsive user interactions, including user authentication, profile management, and system navigation.

#### Technologies Used

- **Next.js**: A React framework designed for server-side rendering and generating static websites from React applications.
- **React**: Used for building interactive UIs, maintaining application state, and handling updates dynamically.
- **Material-UI (MUI)**: A comprehensive React UI library that follows Google's Material Design guidelines.
- **Redux Toolkit**: A toolset for efficient Redux development that simplifies store setup and state management.
- **Axios**: A promise-based HTTP client used for making API requests.

#### File Descriptions

- **package.json**: Lists project dependencies and scripts for building and running the application.
- **index.js/jsx**: Primary React component files that typically handle routing and basic application setup.
- **UserSlice.js**: Manages state for user functionalities within the Redux store, handling actions like user retrieval and update.
- **UsersRepository.js**: Contains functions for API requests related to user management, encapsulating the interactions with backend endpoints.
- **hooks/index.js**: Custom React hooks that aggregate functionality from Redux and other parts of the application state.
- **AuthContext.js**: Context and provider components that manage authentication states, including login, logout, and user session details.

#### Components

- **AuthContext**:
  - Manages user authentication state across the application.
  - Handles user login and logout actions.
  - Initiates user session verification on application start.
- **UserTable.js**:
  - Displays users in a table format.
  - Allows admin interactions such as viewing and editing user profiles.
- **Person.jsx**:
  - A component that displays a person's information in a detailed card format.
  - Provides functionality to toggle visibility of contact details.

#### Pages

- **Login and Registration Pages**: Handle user authentication, allowing new users to register and existing users to log in.
- **User Profile Page**: Allows users to view and edit their personal information.

#### Hooks

- **useUsers**: A custom hook that provides access to user data and actions from the Redux store.
- **useAuth**: Manages authentication processes such as login, logout, and session persistence.

#### Redux State Management

- **UserSlice**: Contains reducers and actions for user-related state management.
- **Store Configuration**: Setup and configuration of the Redux store using Redux Toolkit, integrating middleware and enhancers as necessary.

#### Repository Pattern

- **UsersRepository.js**: Defines functions that handle API requests for user data, abstracting the Axios calls away from the components.

#### Testing

- **Unit and Integration Tests**:
  - **Login.test.js** and **Register.test.js**: Test the login and registration components for correct behavior and error handling.
  - Employ tools like Jest and React Testing Library to ensure components render correctly and function as expected.

#### Configuration

- **Axios Setup**: Configured with baseURL and interceptors for handling request authentication and response processing.
- **Environment Configuration**: Uses environment variables to manage API endpoints and other configurable aspects of the application.

#### Deployment

- **Build and Start Scripts**: Provides commands in `package.json` for building the application for production and running it in development mode.
